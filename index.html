  <h1> About Me</h1><hr></hr> 
  
   <p> Hey everyone, My name is Nadeah Kennedy. I am 20 years old Seattle Native. I like to play volleyball and hang out with my friends. I am an older sister of two 
 and a mother of none.I like to tell jokes too lol. I know that was super corny, that was the point. I have been to a couple of states in America 
    but I would love to travel more even see the world. I love most animals but my favoriate would have to be an elephant, they are the biggest animals on earth and only in two countents. 
  But there size does not define them, they are very smart and loving animals, with an amazing memeory. I wish I could be an elephant, not really though, but it woudl be cool 
  to be one lol. Thats all I have for you guys today, thanks.</p>
